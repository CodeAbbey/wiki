# Basics of Trigonometry


An Angle is formed when two lines or rays intersect.
    
###We can classify angles by their measures         
    Acute angle  	measures less than 90°
    Right angle  	measures 90° 
    Obtuse angle  	measures greater than 90° and less than 180°
    Straight angle 	measures 180° 
    Reﬂex angle  	measures greater than 180° 

**Triangles** are polygons that have three sides, three vertices, and three angles.

###we can classify triangles on the basis of their angles as 
    Acute 	triangle three acute angles
    Obtuse 	triangle one obtuse angle
    Right 	triangle one right angle 
    
###we can classify triangles on the basis of length of their sides as
    Equilateral triangle  all three sides and three angles are equals
    Isosceles triangle 	  at least two two sides and two angles are equal ;
    Scalene triangleno    none of the sides or angles are equal
